# PROGRESS

## 2026-05-21T01:01:26Z

- Started GPT-5.5 builder execution in `/Users/gabrielantonyxaviour/Documents/hackathons/agora-agents-hackathon/execution/2026-05-21T00-46-18Z-agra-committee-governed-grantmaker`.
- Read local `AGENTS.md`, browser execution runbook, profile registry, template index, MotionSites index, and latest Agora council pointer.
- Latest council run resolved to `/Users/gabrielantonyxaviour/Documents/hackathons/agora-agents-hackathon/council/2026-05-20T23-02-17Z`.
- Read `TOP_10.json`, `EXECUTION_QUEUE.json`, `IDEAS.md`, and key council outputs for AGRA.
- Skill discovery found Circle `use-arc` and `use-usdc`; both were installed and read.
- Official Agora page and Circle/Arc docs were checked for submission requirements, judging weights, Arc contract addresses, and sponsor primitives.
- Wrote initial spec and execution plan docs. No browser session opened yet for GitHub/submission/faucet.

- `agent-browser profiles` confirmed `Default (Gabriel)` and the hackathon profile roster.
- `agent-browser` session `agra-github-verify` confirmed GitHub account `gabrielantonyxaviour` in Chrome profile directory `Default`.
- `agent-browser` session `agra-submit-inspect` opened the official Google Form short URL but rendered blank; a read-only `curl` fetch resolved `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgDV0TLAEONtGYDKSjxusDCeqsa4prj01FhoBM2a8NTQvfmA/viewform?usp=send_form` and extracted the required fields.
- `agent-browser` session `agra-faucet-inspect` opened Circle faucet on Arc Testnet and confirmed the address field plus `Send 20 USDC` action; no faucet request submitted yet.

- Generated untracked Arc test wallet `0x58374c7ec9192e2d588e39ACA0eA43f60f432b13` in `.env.local`; `.gitignore` now excludes `.env*`.
- Submitted the wallet address to the Circle faucet twice through `agent-browser`; faucet blocked with unusual-traffic/reCAPTCHA messaging.
- Verified public Arc read path with `cast`: chain ID `5042002`, USDC decimals `6`, wallet balance `0`.
- Began project scaffold with Next.js, viem, zod, Vitest, and Foundry.

## 2026-05-21T02:11:14Z

- Continued the GPT-5.5 build audit in the same execution workspace.
- Fixed committee safety scoring so negative notes like "no private keys" do not trigger the private-key veto.
- Replaced the incompatible `next lint` script with `eslint .`.
- Removed the undeclared `forge-std` dependency from the Foundry test.
- Updated Arc scripts to load `.env.local`, report a zero wallet balance correctly, and keep a separate onchain bytes32 application ID.
- Added stricter wallet validation through `viem` and corrected demo wallet checksums.
- Verified:
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run arc:check`
  - `npm run replay`
  - `forge test`
  - `GET /api/applications`
  - `POST /api/replay`
- Started production app locally at `http://localhost:3003`.
- Attempted M2 Playwright `/polish` route; `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_REMOTE=m2worker` was set, but SSH to `m2worker` timed out. Saved a Playwright CLI report at `/Users/gabrielantonyxaviour/.playwright-sessions/.reports/2026-05-21T02-01-07-935-agra-polish-browser-proof-playwright-cli-remote-.md`.
- Captured fallback `agent-browser` visual QA screenshots at 1440, 768, and 375 widths in `outputs/visual-qa/`.
- Verified GitHub Chrome profile `Default` as `gabrielantonyxaviour`, created public repo `https://github.com/gabrielantonyxaviour/agra-committee-grantmaker`, and added it as `origin`.
- Deployed to Vercel under `rax-tech/agra-committee-grantmaker`; public URL `https://agra-committee-grantmaker.vercel.app` returned HTTP 200 and loaded in browser session `agra-public-verify`.

## 2026-05-21T07:53:58+05:30

- Split the client console into smaller components to satisfy the 300-line file rule.
- Reran `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run lint && npm run build && npm run arc:check && npm run replay && forge test`; all checks passed.
- Pushed `main` to `https://github.com/gabrielantonyxaviour/agra-committee-grantmaker` at commit `15a3ac6`.

## 2026-05-21T07:56:00+05:30

- Pushed final status docs to GitHub at commit `4b197e8`.
- Redeployed production with Vercel; canonical URL `https://agra-committee-grantmaker.vercel.app` returned HTTP 200.
- Browser session `agra-public-final` loaded the public app, confirmed title `AGRA Committee-Governed Grantmaker`, and captured `outputs/visual-qa/public-final-1440.png`.
