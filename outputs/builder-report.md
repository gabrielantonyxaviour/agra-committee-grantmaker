  - `outputs/visual-qa/public-home-1440.png`
  - `outputs/visual-qa/public-final-1440.png`
- No browser console or page errors were reported by `agent-browser`.
- Official `/polish` is not marked passed because the required M2 worker was unreachable.

## Blockers

1. Circle faucet blocked the test wallet funding attempt with an unusual-traffic / verification challenge.
2. Without funded Arc Testnet USDC, `DecisionRegistry` deployment and live `DecisionRecorded` tx cannot be broadcast.
3. M2 worker SSH is unreachable, so the mandatory `/polish` workflow could not run to threshold.
4. Video URL is still missing.
5. Real traction count/quotes are still missing.

## Next Actions

1. Fund `0x58374c7ec9192e2d588e39ACA0eA43f60f432b13` with Arc Testnet USDC or clear the faucet verification challenge.
2. Deploy `DecisionRegistry` and run `npm run replay:broadcast`.
3. Record a sub-3-minute demo video.
4. Collect at least 3 real applicant/tester responses.
5. Rerun `/polish` when `m2worker` is reachable.
6. Fill the Google Form draft fields, stopping before final submission unless Gabriel explicitly approves.
